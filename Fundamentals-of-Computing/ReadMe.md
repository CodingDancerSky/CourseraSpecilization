### Fundamentals of Computing Specialization

Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/fundamentalscomputing2

This sequence of courses introduces to the basics of analyzing and solving computational problems. It begins with an introduction to the Python programming language, transitions to a focus on mathematical and programming techniques, and concludes with an introduction to mathematical tools for reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of algorithms. 

#### An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python

Python is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language.

#### Principles of Computing

This course introduces the basic mathematical and programming principles that underlie much of Computer Science. How to writing Python programs that are both efficient and well-structured, and how to approach more complex computational problems. 

#### Algorithmic Thinking

Solution steps for CS problems: (1) understanding the problem; (2) formulating the problem mathematically; (3) designing an algorithm; (4) implementing the algorithm; and (5) solving the original scientific problem.
