## Coursera Data Science Specialization ##
### Xiangzhu Long ###

I was working on this Specialization from Nov 2014 to August 2015 without certificate

But I found it will help me to apply for a full-time job if I could earn the certificates. Thus, I finished the certificates based on my previous work.
